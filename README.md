# Valuation Dashboard
Web-App that estimate company's value &amp; risk

## Description
Investing in stocks especially by picking stocks that could outperform market is difficult. There are plenty of studies and evidences suggesting that over the years passive indexing in index fund beats active stock picking. In the annual study from S&P Dow Jones Indices for 2020, they found that after 10 years, 85% of large-cap funds underperformed the S&P 500, and after 15 years, nearly 92 percent are trailing the index.

If you still decide to pick stocks even after the fact, you should not spend too much energy in stock picking itself but emphasize more on your learning journey to invest longterm in undervalued quality companies. The author suggests reading books by Benjamin Graham, Philip Fischer and the annual shareholder letter of Warren Buffett.

For 4 years the author has been investing in stocks and since 2020 lockdown in march he is learning programming with Python. This is his first programming project. **This project aims to help the author/everyone during the hustle valuing companies and evaluating its financial data.** The author hopes with this app he doesn't need to scour the internet to copy the financial datas and entering them manualy into calculator to get his final estimation. 
This app is still in work and will be improved over time.
